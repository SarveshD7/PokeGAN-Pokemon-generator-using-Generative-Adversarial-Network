# PokeGAN-Pokemon-generator-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network
Generating new Pokemon images using GAN.
<br>
Trained the network on 819 Pokemon Images.
<br>
Each image is 32x32 and coloured ie, 3 channels.
<br>
After the training the generator takes in a random image with dimensions (32, 32, 3) and produces an image of a random Pokemon.
